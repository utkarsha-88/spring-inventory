/*@SpringBootApplication annotation, means this is the starting point for our Spring Boot application.
Spring Boot developers like their apps to use auto-configuration, component scan and be able to define extra configuration on their "application class". A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:

@EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism
@ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located
@Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes*/
